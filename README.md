At the beginning of the Major League Baseball season, I started playing on an app called Beat The Streak. The objective of the game is to beat Joe Dimaggio's hit streak of 56 games. Every day, you have the option to pick one or two players to get a hit during their games. If they get a hit, your streak continues, while if someone doesn't get a hit, your streak resets. The Beat The Streak app also comes with a bunch of stats that tell you the ERA of a pitcher, the batters batting average, who's playing at home or away, etc. When I first started playing, I picked Houston Astros shortstop, Carlos Correa to get a hit. That night, he failed to hit. I ended up picking him again about a week later, but this time he reached base. While the Beat The Streak app comes with a lot of stats, I was curious whether there was a pattern a batter followed when hitting. I wondered if a batter got a hit most games earlier in the season over the course of his career or later in the season. I wondered if there was a pattern at all.
